Challenges met while creating app for future reference.

1. Implementing drag and drop elements for the ticket board.  Not as familiar with JS, so definite learning opportunity.

2. Finding good project structure.  IE Controller for each view?, Controller for related views?, functions in classes for creating/loading/deleting bugs or REST/HTTP operations through controller, what interfaces to use?

3. Started with Dapper for DB context, so different setup and query implementation than EF.  Switched over because I decided to use Identity for user login and could use the same DB context for CRUD operations instead of having 2 different contexts.
EF process invovled setting up classes which represent the DB tables and adding migration.

4. Took a few days to get Identity login working.  (NEW CONCEPT AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR ME, SO IT WAS COMPLETE LEARNING PROCESS). 
Made AccountController which took in AppUser and SignInManager Classes.
Public async Task<IActionResult> Register/Login.
Checks if user is already created and if not instantiates new AppUser and fills in details based on what is entered.

5. Had to backtrack to refactor all the functionality of Loading/Creating bugs through class functions and using Dapper to Controller requests and using EF

6.Overall consolidation of repeated code to make for cleaner project

7.First time using GreenSock for animation.  Pretty Cool.
